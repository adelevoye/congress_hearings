These files contain the code I used for my papers on Congressional hearings. See here for working paper: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1efKCveuOh7wIVaiGY2NzPmB1vewNSPS2/view?usp=sharing\

They include code to:
- Use the Congressional Publishing Office\'92s API to get a list of hearings\
- Scrape information for these hearings from the GPO\'92s website\
- Analyze the information from this dataset\


The complete dataset, which includes variables on ideologies and affiliations coded by RAs and myself, is available on demand. }
